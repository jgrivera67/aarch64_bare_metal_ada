# aarch64_bare_metal_ada

This repository contains a collection of bare-metal SPARK Ada software components
that can be used as an infrastructure to develop multicore system-level software
in Ada, for AArch64-based embedded platforms. They can be used as a foundation to
develop boot ROMs, boot loaders, multicore RTOS kernels, separation kernels and
hypervisors in Ada, for AArch64-based platforms.

A tutorial that teaches how to develop 64-bit bare-metal embedded software in SPARK Ada for Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 5, using components from this repository, is included [here](docs/tutorial.md).
